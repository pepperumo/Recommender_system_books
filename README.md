# Goodreads Recommender System

## Overview
The **Goodreads Recommender System** is a machine learning-based recommendation engine designed to suggest books based on user ratings and book metadata. By leveraging various recommendation techniques, this system enhances user experience and book discovery.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Uses a hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to suggest books.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Implements an SVM-based hybrid recommendation model.
- **Scalability:** Handles large datasets efficiently with optimized processing techniques.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyzes user preferences to generate meaningful book suggestions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Data Handling:** CSV files containing Goodreads user ratings and book metadata

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and then install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Train the recommender model using the SVM hybrid algorithm.
3. Generate book recommendations for users.
4. Evaluate model performance.

Run the Jupyter Notebook `Recommender_system.ipynb` to explore and execute the full workflow.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a large-scale Goodreads dataset containing user ratings and book metadata. The dataset is split into multiple CSV files for efficient processing.

## Model Training
The system employs a hybrid recommendation technique using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning-based recommendation models.
- Optimize performance for large-scale datasets.
- Enhance user-based filtering techniques.
